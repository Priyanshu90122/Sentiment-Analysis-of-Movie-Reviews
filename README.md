🎬 Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

📖 Overview

This project is based on Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using Python, Deep Learning, and Tkinter. The goal of the project is to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using a deep learning model. It uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras and trained on the IMDb movie review dataset. Once trained, the model can analyze the sentiment of any text review entered by the user. The project also includes a simple Tkinter GUI, where users can type a movie review and instantly get the predicted sentiment displayed on the screen in an easy-to-understand format.



🌟 Features

Deep learning-based LSTM model for text sentiment classification.

Classifies reviews as Positive 😊 or Negative 😞.

Simple, clean, and user-friendly Tkinter GUI.

Automatically trains the model when the code runs for the first time.

Uses IMDb dataset built into Keras, so no external data is needed.

Easy to run and understand for beginners in AI and ML.
